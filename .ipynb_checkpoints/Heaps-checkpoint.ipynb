    "Given an input stream of  integers, you must perform the following task for each  integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add the  integer to a running list of integers.\n",
    "* Find the median of the updated list (i.e., for the first element through the  element).\n",
    "* Print the list's updated median on a new line. The printed value must be a double-precision number scaled to  decimal place (i.e.,  format).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm goes like this: for each value, put it to an appropriate heap and 'rebalance' the heaps so that their size is not different by more than 1. Then, to get the median, just pull out the first element from the bigger heap, or take an average of the first elements of the two heaps if they are of equal size."
